        "description": "In many web applications, managing state is far too complex; creating, maintaining, modifying, and troubleshooting it takes far too much work. React and Redux now offer an easier, more elegant solution. In Building React.js Applications with Redux, leading Web frameworks expert David Geary demonstrates how to implement web apps with these technologies, making state far more reliable and less error-prone. Starting with the basics, Geary shows how to use Redux as a stand-alone state container, how to use Redux with React, and then how to implement more advanced and powerful Redux/React scenarios. Geary shows how React bindings for Redux enable you to separate stateless presentation components from components that are connected to React. You'll learn how react-redux bindings can automatically connect to the Redux store, and how they enforce good programming practice by separating concerns between containers and their associated stateless components. Geary also illustrates advanced aspects of Redux through a complex application example. The only up-to-date and comprehensive guide to React and Redux, Building React.js Applications with Redux covers all these key topics: Implementing and using action creators Creating asynchronous actions Implementing undo and redo Implementing a state timeline Encapsulating creation of actions in functions to improve code readability Combining reducers Routing, testing, and much more",
